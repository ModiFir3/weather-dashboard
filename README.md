# Description

With this website I wanted to create a way for users to view the weather of their local area or anywhere else that they had in mind. Once the user types in a valid city they will be prompted with the current weather information as well as a five day forecast for that imputed city. Within this website it will be able to save any data that the user inputs to the localstorage and will create a button for the user so if they wish to look over the city they have previously inputted.
